Yo zouix this side.
building games and AI stuff. learning by making things instead of watching 10-hour tutorial playlists like everyone else.

Stack: javascript, python, c#, java, react, tensorflow
Focus: game dev, machine learning, anything that pushes what's possible

Learning multiple languages at once because different tools solve different problems. currently exploring game engines and conversational AI models.

Not interested in making another crud app or following someone's 10-hour tutorial series. if you're working on something that actually requires thinking, let's talk.

ship code that works. optimize later if it matters.
